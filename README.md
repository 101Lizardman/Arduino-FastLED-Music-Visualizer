# Arduino-FastLED-Music-Visualizer
An Arduino based music visualizer using the FastLED library and a strip of individually addressable LEDs.

## Intro
Imagine this scenario. Does this not make you want to create your own music visualizer?

`> want to be super cool 1337 h4x0r 420 cuck`  
`> make led music visualizer from `[`the.red.team`](https://www.github.com/the-red-team)  
`> get it working perfectly`  
`> decide to use the shrooms my friend gave me for the first time and listen to music while watching the lights`  
`> nothing`  
`> nothing`  
`> need more shrooms but ate them all`  
`> leave house on scavenging mission in search of more fungal friends`  
`> crawled inside of the neighbor's dog`  
`> dog walks inside of neighbor house`  
`> broke into neighbor house by being inside of dog`  
`> it is night now`

# Setup
So this is how to setup the most "dank" music visualizer ever.  
I can't find a guide worth a shit on YouTube or Github so here you go.  
There will be two ways to set this puppy up. I prefer the second way, but that costs money and shit.

## Materials
